# Computer Vision Capstone Project

The Project: Facial Keypoint Detection
For the Computer Vision capstone project in the AI Nanodegree program I combined my knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning to build and end-to-end facial keypoint recognition system. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on any face and are used in many applications, from facial tracking to emotion recognition. The code is able to take in any image containing faces and identify the location of each face and their facial keypoints, as shown below.

### Project Components
The project is broken up into a few main parts in one Python notebook:

Part 1: Investigating OpenCV, pre-processing, and face detection

Part 2 : Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect facial keypoints

Part 3 : Putting parts 1 and 2 together to identify facial keypoints on any image!
